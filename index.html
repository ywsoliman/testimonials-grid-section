                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                    learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                    joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&apos;s worth.

                    I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                    I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard
                    some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                    - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                    course, I&apos;ve successfully switched careers, working as
                    a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                    themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
                    their experiences was easy.

                    The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
                    find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
                    necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
                    myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above
                    the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

                <blockquote>
                    Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line
                    of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as
                    an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped
                    me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple offers. 100% recommend!
